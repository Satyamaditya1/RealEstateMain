                Blockchain technology is a decentralized, immutable ledger that records transactions across a network of computers. Each transaction, or "block," is linked to the previous one, forming a chain. This structure ensures transparency and security, as altering any block would require changing all subsequent blocks, which is computationally impractical. Blockchain's key features include transparency, as transactions are visible to all network participants; security, due to cryptographic encryption; and decentralization, removing the need for a central authority. Applications extend beyond cryptocurrencies to supply chain management, voting systems, and more, promising to revolutionize
